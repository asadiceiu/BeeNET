# BeeTrackingGUI

## Overview

**BeeTrackingGUI** is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) designed for tracking bees in video footage. This tool integrates bee detection, Kalman filter-based tracking, and user interaction for zone assignment and real-time monitoring. The system is tailored for researchers and enthusiasts working with bee tracking data, providing an intuitive interface to manage and analyze bee movement.

## Features

- **Video Playback Control**: Load, play, pause, and stop video files to review bee tracking footage.
- **Bee Detection**: Integrated YOLO-based detector (`bee_detector_yolo.py`) for identifying bees in video frames.
- **Tracking with Kalman Filter**: Utilizes a Kalman filter (`kalman_tracker.py`) to track the movement of bees over time.
- **Zone Assignment**: Assign specific zones within the video frame to analyze bee activity in predefined areas.
- **Real-Time Statistics**: Display tracking statistics such as the number of bees that have entered, exited, or remained inside designated zones.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You will also need the following Python libraries:

- `tkinter`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `opencv-python`
- `torch` (for YOLO)
- `shapely` (optional, depending on implementation)

You can install these dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install tkinter matplotlib numpy opencv-python torch shapely
```

### Cloning the Repository

Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/BeeTrackingGUI.git
cd BeeTrackingGUI
```

## Usage

Run the main GUI application:

```bash
python bee_tracker_gui.py
```

### Files Description

- **bee_tracker_gui.py**: The main GUI application file. This file handles the user interface and integrates all components of the system.
- **kalman_tracker.py**: Implements the Kalman filter used for tracking bees across video frames.
- **bee_detector_yolo.py**: Contains the YOLO-based detection algorithm for identifying bees in video footage.

## Example

Below is an example of how to use the BeeTrackingGUI:

1. Load your video file by clicking the "Load Video" button.
2. Use the "Assign Zone" feature to define specific areas within the video for analysis.
3. Start the bee detection and tracking process by clicking "Track Bees."
4. Monitor the real-time tracking statistics and adjust parameters as needed.
